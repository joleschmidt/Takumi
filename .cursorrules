# Takumi Project Rules

## Section Height Management
- All full-screen sections should use `h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` to account for the navbar height (4rem = 64px)
- This ensures sections align perfectly with the viewport bottom edge
- Never use `overflow-y-auto` on sections - it creates annoying scrollbars
- Use `max-h-screen` only if you want to limit height but allow natural scrolling

## Section Structure Pattern
For full-viewport sections:
```tsx
<section className="relative h-[calc(100vh-4rem)] flex items-center bg-background">
  <div className="container px-4 md:px-6 w-full">
    {/* content */}
  </div>
</section>
```

## Image Sizing in Sections
- Use `h-full` with `min-h-[400px]` or similar for responsive image containers
- Avoid fixed aspect ratios that might cause overflow
- Use `object-cover` for background images to maintain aspect ratio
